{"label": "BACKGROUND", "sentence": "In the present study , we examined the association between outcome after acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) and the plasma levels of MAp44 and its related proteins MASP-1 and MASP-3 in patients with first-time MI .\n"}

{"label": "METHODS", "sentence": "A total of 192 MI patients and 140 control persons were included .\n"}

{"label": "METHODS", "sentence": "The myocardial outcomes ( salvage index and final infarct size ) were measured by gated single-photon emission CT. .\n"}
{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "MI patients had 18 % higher plasma levels of MAp44 ( IQR 11-25 % ) as compared to the healthy control group ( p < 0.001 .\n"}
{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "However , neither salvage index ( Spearman rho -0.1 , p = 0.28 ) nor final infarct size ( Spearman rho 0.02 , p = 0.83 ) correlated with plasma levels of MAp44 .\n"}
{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "Likewise , MASP-1 and MASP-3 were elevated in MI patients ( p = 0.002 and p < 0.001 ) , but the levels were not correlated to outcome .\n"}

{"label": "OBJECTIVE", "sentence": "We tested whether a brief cognitive behavioral ( CB ) group and bibliotherapy prevention reduce major depressive disorder ( MDD ) onset , depressive symptoms , and secondary outcomes relative to brochure controls in adolescents with self-reported depressive symptoms when school personnel recruit participants and deliver the intervention .\n"}
{"label": "METHODS", "sentence": "Three hundred seventy-eight adolescents ( M age = 15.5 years , SD = 1.2 ; 68 % female , 72 % White ) with elevated self-assessed depressive symptoms were randomized to a 6-session CB group , minimal contact CB bibliotherapy , or educational brochure control .\n"}

{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "CB group participants showed a significantly lower risk for major depressive disorder onset ( 0.8 % ) , compared to both CB bibliotherapy ( 6.3 % ) and brochure control ( 6.5 % ; hazard ratio = 8.1 and 8.3 , respectively ) .\n"}
{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "Planned contrasts indicated that CB group resulted in lower depressive symptom severity than brochure control at posttest ( p = .03 , d = 0.29 ) but not 6-month follow-up ; differences between CB group and bibliotherapy were nonsignificant at posttest and 6-month follow-up .\n"}
{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "Condition effects were nonsignificant for social adjustment and substance use .\n"}
{"label": "CONCLUSIONS", "sentence": "The finding that a brief CB group intervention delivered by real-world providers significantly reduced MDD onset relative to both brochure control and bibliotherapy is very encouraging , although effects on continuous outcome measures were small or nonsignificant and approximately half the magnitude of those found in efficacy research , potentially because the present sample reported lower initial depression .\n"}
{"label": "BACKGROUND", "sentence": "The purpose of these two studies was to define the optimal therapeutic dose of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron ( Navoban , ICS 205-930 ) in cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting .\n"}
{"label": "METHODS", "sentence": "In two multicentre , dose-finding studies of tropisetron in the prevention of cisplatin-induced emesis , cancer patients nave to chemotherapy or who had not vomited previously were randomly assigned to tropisetron 5 , 10 , 20 or 40 mg ( study I , 143 patients ) or 2 or 5 mg ( study II , 74 patients ) , administered as a single intravenous dose over 15 minutes just before the start of chemotherapy .\n"}

{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "Total or major control of vomiting ( < or = 2 emetic episodes ) was the primary endpoint in study II and was seen in 68 % of patients for the 2-mg and 86 % for the 5-mg group ( p = 0.055 ) .\n"}

{"label": "RESULTS", "sentence": "Three of 8 rescue infusions administered in the 2-mg group prevented further vomiting whereas none of 5 were successful in the 5-mg group during course 1 of chemotherapy .\n"}

{"label": "CONCLUSIONS", "sentence": "These studies do not allow a firm conclusion but suggest that 2 mg may be subtherapeutic and that 5 mg is as effective as higher doses .\n"}
