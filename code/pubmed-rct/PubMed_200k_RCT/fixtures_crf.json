{"pmid": 30176582, "abstract": "Segmentation of suspicious regions (SRs) of a thermal breast image (TBI) is a very significant and challenging problem for identification of breast cancer. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed an active contour model for the segmentation of the SRs in a TBI. The proposed segmentation method combines three significant steps. First, a novel method, called smaller-peaks corresponding to the high-intensity-pixels and the centroid-knowledge of SRs (SCH-CS), is proposed to approximately locate the SRs, whose contours are later used as the initial evolving curves of the level set method (LSM). Second, a new energy functional, called different local priorities embedded (DLPE), is proposed regarding the level set function. DLPE is then minimized using the interleaved level set evolution to segment the potential SRs in a TBI more accurately. Finally, a new stopping criterion is incorporated into the proposed LSM. The proposed LSM not only increases the segmentation speed but also ameliorates the segmentation accuracy. Performance of our SR segmentation method was evaluated on two TBI databases, namely, DMR-IR and DBT-TU-JU and the average segmentation accuracies obtained on these databases are 72.18% and 71.26% respectively, which are better than other state-of-the-art methods. Beside this, a novel framework to analyze TBIs is proposed for differentiating abnormal and normal breasts on the basis of the segmented SRs. We have also shown experimentally that investigating only the SRs instead of the whole breast is more effective in differentiating abnormal and normal breasts."}

Higher incidence of lung cancer may be associated with residential proximity to a petrochemical industrial complex (PIC) due to exposure to various carcinogens, although results from previous epidemiologic studies remain inconclusive. Because disease burden due to residential inequality is a public health and societal concern, this study analyzed published data to estimate lung cancer incidence in association with residential proximity to PICs. We performed a meta-analysis on selected epidemiologic studies that met the following criteria: lung cancer incidence was coded by the International Classification of Diseases; exposure groups were clearly defined as residents living near PICs; and confidence intervals were available or calculable from original articles. We further applied a population attributable factor (PAF) method to estimate disease burden attributable to living near PICs in 22 European Union (EU) countries. Meta-analysis included six studies with a total of 466,066 residents living near PICs in six countries. Residents living near PICs had a 19% higher risk of lung cancer compared to those who lived farther away (95% CI = 1.06-1.32). By sex, risks were higher and more significant for females (RR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.09-1.54; P = 0.004) than males (RR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.95-1.33; P = 0.173). By location, only groups in Europe had a significantly greater risk of lung cancer with exposure to PICs (95% CI = 1.03-1.33; P = 0.019), although groups in other locations showed similar trends. By bona fide observation, observation of residents for at least seven years provided sufficient latency to estimate risk (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.17-1.34; P < 0.001). Regarding burden of lung cancer in 22 EU countries, 494 males and 478 females were attributed to living in the vicinity of a PIC annually. Lung cancer incidence is significantly higher in individuals living near PICs. This result provides strong epidemiologic evidence for further policy to regulate potential pollutants near PICs. Higher incident rates of lung cancer for residents living close to petrochemical industry complex."}
{"pmid": 30258371, "abstract": "Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based, behavioral dyadic treatment for caregivers and their children aged 2-7 years old with emotional and behavioral disorders. Here we present a treatment course of a 3-years-old girl with leukoencephalopathy, dysgenesis of the brainstem, and associated global developmental delay who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy after PCIT completion. At the beginning of PCIT she had the developmental level of an 18 months old with language skills of a 12-18 months old; both her vocabulary and verbal expression were very limited. She had slow, unco-ordinated gait with limited fine motor skills. She was referred to Psychiatry with concerns regarding disruptive behaviors including severe self-injury. PCIT was started with a focus on PRIDE skills (Praise, Reflection, Imitation, behavioral Description and Enjoyment); particularly behavioral description and reflection with simple developmentally appropriate labeled praise. Modifications to treatment included using non-verbal actions (e.g., 'high fives' as praises), sign language and using only one-step basic commands, which greatly improved compliance. In a matter of weeks, the patient demonstrated remarkable improvement in her disruptive behavior as evidenced by parent/daycare report and clinical observation. Surprisingly her vocabulary more than doubled and her ability of self-expression also increased; she was able to point to things and ask for them. This clinical experience suggests that PCIT principles are effective treatment interventions for other clinical presentations outside of the usual inclusion criteria. Implementation of targeted PCIT interventions greatly benefited the development of language skills and communication in a young child with global developmental delay."}
{"pmid": 30249523, "abstract": "Food literacy research typically conceptualizes food-related knowledge and skills as contributing to improved health and nutrition; however, there is limited research examining the process that leads to this improvement. This article reviews the literature reporting barriers to food literacy proficiency in order to examine the relationship between food-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Informed by these barrier types, its central objective is to develop a model of food literacy proficiency that highlights the relationship between nutrition education and health-related outcomes. This model will help researchers, educators, and nutrition professionals implement effective interventions with enhanced capacity to change food-related behaviors."}
{"pmid": 30471295, "abstract": "Paclitaxel chemotherapy treatment often leads to neuropathic pain resistant to available analgesic treatments. Recently spinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) were identified to be involved in the pro-nociceptive effect of paclitaxel. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and serine/threonine kinases in this process, with the use of their antagonists (wortmannin, LY-294002 and staurosporine). The single paclitaxel administration (8 mg/kg i.p.) in mice induced robust mechanical allodynia measured as reduced threshold to von Frey filament stimulation and generated reduced tachyphylaxis of capsaicin evoked responses, recorded as changes in mEPSC frequency in patch-clamp recordings of dorsal horn neurons activity in vitro, for up to eight days. Paclitaxel application also induced increased Akt kinase phosphorylation in rat DRG neurons. All these paclitaxel-induced changes were prevented by the the wortmannin in vivo pretreatment. Acute co-application of wortmannin or LY-294002 with paclitaxel in spinal cord slices also attenuated the paclitaxel effect on capsaicin evoked responses. Staurosporine was effective in the acute in vitro experiments and on the first day after the paclitaxel treatment in vivo, but in contrast to wortmannin it did not have a significant impact later. Our data suggest that the inhibition of PI3K signaling may help alleviate pathological pain syndromes in the paclitaxel-induced neuropathy."}
